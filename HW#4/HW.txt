1.  JavaScript  is a ubiquitous-used object-oriented programming language. A compiled language is converted into usable code so that the processor can execute it. An interpreted language is a language where implementations execute instructions directly without compiling a program into machine language beforehand. Overall, compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.


2. 
a. Var is a key word used to declare variables and is scoped to the entire function they are declared in. Var can declare global-scoped variables.
b. Let is a key word that declares block-scoped variables. This means that the variable is only accessible within the code block between the curly brackets. In using Let, you avoid creating global variables and hoisting. 
c. Const is similar to both Let and Var as const can be scoped to both blocks and functions but once declared it cannot be changed throughout the entire code.


3. 
a. A anonymous function is a function that has no name in that it does not have any identification when created. 
b. A higher-order function is a function which accepts other functions as parameters and/or returns a function. You can think of it like a function that has influence over other functions or an employer that has influence over their employees.


4. A javaScript object is an item in a state and with a behavior. JavaScript objects are different than in other languages because an object can be created by defining its properties and methods directly without the need for a class. Additionally, objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects.

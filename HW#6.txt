1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a collection of request
 methods that specify what action is to be performed on a particular resource. 
The most common are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE which respectively
create, read, update, and delete a chosen resource. 

2. 
An API (Application Programming Interface) define the rules and protocols
 that allows different software applications to communicate and share data
or functionality with each other. They allow developers to gain access
to another software system, service, or platform without needing to
 understand its internal workings.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is standard text-based
 format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to
 parse and generate. It is language-independent meaning it can be used with any
 programming language.

3. 
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is set of programming techniques 
that utilize JavaScript to exchange data between a web browser
and a web server without making the user wait for this process to be 
completed. AJAX is used to enhance the interactivity of webpages.

Asynchronous code is code that does not block user input 
while one or more operations are in progress. With this programming, 
multiple related operations can run at the same time 
without having to wait for other tasks to complete.

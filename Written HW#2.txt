1.  
1. When elements are described as semantic they are text elements that are not meant to change the structure of web pages but add extra information. 
2. Elements denoted as structural are elements used to describe headings and paragraphs, affecting the structure of web pages. 


2. Correct html elements are essential when designing web pages because they control the structure of the page (headings, paragraphs) and provide semantic information (where emphasis is placed, what text is a quotation). If these elements are used incorrectly then the web page will have poor structure and the user will not be able to easily navigate or properly understand the page. 


3. In HTML, forms are tools that can be used to gather user information. Forms allow for easy user interface and are commonly used to by a many companies to gather data. The type of form that should be used is based on context. For instance, use check boxes when you have a question with more than one response or use radio buttons with questions that only have one answer.  
 
4. 1. Inline elements are elements that will always continue to be on the same line as their neighbor. Examples include <span> and <text> 
2. On the other hand, block elements are elements that will always appear on a new line in the browser window. Examples include <h1> and <li>

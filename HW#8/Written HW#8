1. Escaping data is the process of securing output data by removing 
unwanted data such as malformed HTML or script tags (fix syntax).
This process helps secure data before rendering it for the end user.
Additionally, it helps prevent XSS attacks by converting key characters
of data (such as < and > for HTML) which prevents them from being interpreted
in a dangerous context.

a. REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a style 
for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it 
easier for systems to communicate with each other. Systems following this
style, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by being 
stateless and separating the concerns of client and server. 
Stateless means that the server does not need to know 
anything about the state of the client and vice versa.

b. Resources describe any object, document, 
or thing that you may need to store or send to other services.

3. Margin, padding, and border
1. Borders separate the edge of one box from another
2. Margins are outside the edge of the border where they determine the space between borders of adjacent boxes 
3. Padding is the space between the border of a box and the content inside of it. Padding separates the content of the box from its edges. 


4. Flexbox rules: 
1. Display:flex - Defines a flex container which can be inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.


2. Flex-direction: Defines the direction flex items are placed in the flex container (establishes the main-axis). Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Flex items primarily lay out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.


3. Flex-wrap: By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.


4. justify-content/align-items: Justify-content defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line. /// Align-items defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. 


5. Align-content: This aligns a flex container’s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.
